Today MicroStrategy  [announced](http://ir.microstrategy.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=902795) that it has certified its platform with Apache Drill. According to MicroStrategy's CTO, Tim Lang, Drill reduces the time-to-value for MicroStrategy users, and enables them to leverage multi-structured data.

Many early adopters of Drill have been interested in leveraging MicroStrategy's powerful BI platform. With it's first-class support for self-describing data and evolving structure, Drill enables MicroStrategy users to explore and analyze the data in Hadoop and NoSQL databases without the usual friction that comes with having to define and manage schemas.

If you would like to learn more about this integration, [sign up](http://info.microstrategy.com/accessing-multi-structured-data-sources) for MicroStrategy's webinar next month, which includes a live demo of the integration with Drill.

Happy Drilling!
