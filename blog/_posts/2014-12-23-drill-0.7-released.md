I'm excited to announce that the community has just released Drill 0.7, which includes [228 resolved JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12313820&version=12327473) and numerous enhancements such as: 

* No dependency on UDP multicast. Drill can now work on EC2, as well as clusters with multiple subnets or multihomed configurations
* [Automatic partition pruning](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DRILL/Partition+Pruning) based on directory structures
* New nested data functions: [KVGEN](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DRILL/KVGEN+Function) and [FLATTEN](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DRILL/FLATTEN+Function)
* Fast "schema" return. This provides a better experience when using BI tools
* Hive 0.13 Metastore support
* Improved performance for queries on JSON data

You can now [download Drill 0.7]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/). As always, you may check out the official [release notes](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DRILL/Release+Notes) for more details.
